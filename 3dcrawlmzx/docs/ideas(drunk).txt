man struggles with the raider persona

this is what he is, he takes and he raids and he slaughters and he destroys and he's cocky
the things he makes are success and destruction, he wields the weapons of command and power
the world falls apart around him, he tries to change, he tries to be the nicer guy
he tries to be the one doing the right thing, he tries to be the one correcting the onslaught
but the only way out, the only way to be the light in the darkness even when he doesn't want 
anything else is to only be what he was meant to be, the raider, despair in that hatred and
destruction is all that he is, power in the purest purpose, finding the one thing that he
was meant to be

first person RPG
three man party

main character, the big show
two characters, the help

skills for all three characters are determined by pool/class

skills are found, so are stat increases, basically everything is quested for. you're already
powerful, no need to make it a thing where you have to feel like a weak ass pussy for the
first five levels

avoid the 5 types of quests, fed-ex, collect, kill x, escort, fetch

no set number of quests at a time, but no traditional quest log. no questhelper, no direct
link to the quest information.  must find out and make notes on your own
