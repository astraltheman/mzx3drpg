[Maxim:  This version of PalMaster should make editing SMZX palettes faster than ever.]

This is my first read me, I've never made a utility program before. Let's get the basics covered.

* = New in PalMaster II

Arrow Keys - Change colour
R - Increase red in selected colour
G - Increase green
B - Increase blue
*A - Increase all
Shift+R - Decrease red in selected colour
Shift+G - Decrease green
Shift+B - Decrease blue
*Shift+A - Decrease all
*Space - Fast edit color  (Fast edit controls:  Up/down to pick a value, left/right to modify value.)
  Hold shift to modify values faster.
*Left click - Copy color
*Right click - Paste color
Tab - Flips between the solid colour palette and the palette displaying the colour combos
  [Maxim:  Tab now allows view of smzx2 palette with gradients.]
*P - Change gradient pattern
L - Load a palette
S - Save a palette
Backspace/*Delete - Blacken colour
0 to 9 - Stores selected colour in a slot (0-9)
Shift+0 to 9 - Retrieves saved colour from the numbered slot and overwrites selected colour

Note: You can press R+G+B at the same time and the colours will all increase at the same time, and decrease if you add shift.  [Maxim:  Still featured, but obsolete unless you want to press R+G or G+B or something.]

That's all there is to it! Simply make sure you take some other palette file and rename it to what you want to save your palette as; this thing can't create .pal files out of nothing so you'll have to save over an old one.  [Maxim:  No longer true, it saves new files for me.]

Special thanks to LogiCow, mOdac, Exophase, Galladin, gnert, astral. They all believed in me! <3

Hope you all enjoy!
